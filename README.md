this is a ripoff of cookie clicker lol.
This is written using JAVA 9 and the UI in Javafx and fxml.

My Java version:
  java version "9.0.1"
  Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 9.0.1+11)
  Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 9.0.1+11, mixed mode)

The .jar can be found in the root folder.
  It doesn't run on other systems though.
  I don't know why.

The UI is pretty ugly and could use some work.
  It needs a color scheme
  I was thinking of maybe doing a command-line interface with commands like "purchase" and "quit" and "save-all"
  The main button could be better
